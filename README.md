# Au-NPs-cement-composites
Four python modules are presented to analyze measured data from mechanical and electrical characterizations.

Module.py instance the classes pro_data and semiCircleEISModel to use their methods. pro_data, simultaneously call the JSON object where the data files were organized by experimental setup and its path name.

20210128 update python 2 code to python 3 code 
We change dictionary.has_key('key'): for 'key' in dictionary:
20210129 We need to change the attribute join from python 2.0 instead attribute in python 3.0
